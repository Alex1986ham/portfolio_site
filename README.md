# portfolio_site

This "portfolio site" shows all projects created so far by Alexander Dudko.

# Quickstart 

After downloading the GitHub folder, the page can be started via index. html.

# Structure of the code

The page consists of 4 sections:

- Header: this shows the developer
- Main Content Box: can contain images or other information.
- Featured Work: shows the individual projects that have already been completed. Under each project there is a description and a link to the GitHub Repo
- Footer: may contain additional information about the site. Currently it contains only one line as delimitation to the "featured work" area
